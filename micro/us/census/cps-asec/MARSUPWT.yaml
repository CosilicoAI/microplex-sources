notes: |
  MARSUPWT is the recommended weight for income and tax unit analysis.
  Raw values are scaled by 100, so divide by 100 for actual population counts.

  This weight accounts for:
  - Sample design
  - Non-response adjustment
  - Post-stratification to population controls

  Use this weight (not A_FNLWGT) for income-related statistics.
