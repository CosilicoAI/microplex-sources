# IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) State-Level Data Sources

This document catalogs available IRS SOI data sources with state-level breakdowns for use in tax-benefit microsimulation calibration.

## Overview

The IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) Division provides comprehensive state-level tax data derived from individual income tax returns (Forms 1040). These datasets are essential for:

- Calibrating microsimulation models to match administrative totals
- Validating income distributions by state and AGI bracket
- Cross-checking survey data (CPS, ACS) against tax records

## Data Quality Notes

### Sampling

- Data derived from samples of filed returns (before audit)
- Represents Forms 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ (historical), 1040-SR
- Electronic and paper returns included

### Suppression

- Small cells may be suppressed to prevent disclosure
- ZIP-level data particularly affected
- State totals generally complete

### Rounding

- Dollar amounts typically in thousands or millions
- Return counts may be rounded to nearest thousand
- Check documentation guide for specific year

### Timing

- Tax Year vs. Filing Year distinction important
- Most data released 18-24 months after tax year end
- Preliminary vs. final releases may differ

### Coverage

- Represents tax filers only (not total population)
- Non-filers excluded (significant for low-income analysis)
- Number of exemptions approximates but does not equal population

## ETL Roadmap

### Currently Implemented

**`etl_soi_state.py`**: Basic state-level loader for Historic Table 2

Variables loaded:
- `tax_unit_count` (number of returns)
- `adjusted_gross_income` (total AGI)
- `income_tax_liability` (total tax)

States covered: Top 5 by population (CA, TX, FL, NY, PA)

Years: 2020-2021

### Phase 1: Expand State Coverage (Priority: High)

Extend to all 50 states + DC:
- Download and parse CSV files from Historic Table 2
- Add state FIPS mapping for all jurisdictions
- Implement automated download from IRS

### Phase 2: Add AGI Bracket Stratification (Priority: High)

Create state x AGI bracket strata:
- Parse bracket columns from Historic Table 2 CSV
- Create hierarchical strata (national -> state -> bracket)
- Enable calibration to income distribution by state

### Phase 3: Income by Source (Priority: Medium)

Add income component breakdowns:
- Wages and salaries
- Interest income
- Dividend income
- Capital gains (from AGI Percentile tables)
- Business income
- Partnership/S-Corp income

Source: AGI Percentile Data by State (Table 2)

### Phase 4: Credits and Deductions (Priority: Medium)

Add refundable credit targets:
- EITC by state (from EITC statistics)
- Child Tax Credit by state
- Additional Child Tax Credit by state

Add deduction targets:
- Itemized vs. standard deduction counts
- Itemized deduction amounts by type

Source: State Data FY tables, Publication 1304

### Phase 5: Sub-State Geography (Priority: Low)

Add ZIP code and county level data:
- County-level income totals
- ZIP code aggregates for metro areas
- Migration flow data

### Phase 6: Time Series (Priority: Low)

Backfill historical data:
- Extend to 1996-present
- Handle format changes across years
- Track methodology changes

---

## Implementation Notes

### CSV Parsing

Historic Table 2 CSV structure (2022):
```
STATE, STATE_NAME, AGI_STUB, N1, A00100, N02650, A02650, ...
```

Where:
- `STATE`: State FIPS code
- `AGI_STUB`: AGI bracket code (1-10+)
- `N1`: Number of returns
- `A00100`: AGI amount
- Field names follow Form 1040 line numbers

### Strata Design

Recommended hierarchy:
```
US All Filers
  -> US Filers AGI $50k-$75k
  -> CA All Filers
       -> CA Filers AGI $50k-$75k
```

Use `parent_id` for rollup validation.

### Validation

Cross-check against:
- Census ACS income estimates
- BEA personal income by state
- CPS ASEC weighted totals
